  "description": "Amtrak's station autocomplete uses a dynamic suggestion endpoint and a supporting static station list. The dynamic endpoint returns suggestions based on a searchTerm, while the static list provides the full station catalog used for client-side filtering.",
  "url": "https://www.amtrak.com/services/MapDataService/AutoCompleterArcgis/getResponseList",
  "method": "GET",
  "explanation": "The dynamic autocomplete request to MapDataService/AutoCompleterArcgis/getResponseList includes a searchTerm query (e.g., searchTerm=bos) and returns an autoCompleterResponse with autoCompleteList items such as \"Boston, MA - South Station (BOS)\". In addition, the application loads a static station directory from https://www.amtrak.com/services/data.stations.json, which contains station entries with fields like autoFillName and code, supporting local autocomplete behavior.",
